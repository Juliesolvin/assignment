# assignment 2, java

Assignment by Julie Solvin Jacobsen and Soukaina Salam

Project contains of models, controllers, data_access and main. 

In main, the application class is placed.

In models, the shell/representation of the different variables are placed.

In controllers, we have a Thymeleaf controller and Customer controller.
The Thymeleaf controller has a focus on representing the front-end and showing of 5 random songs ect., and the Customer controller has focus on Customer-classes.

In data_Access we have the repositories, that is communicating to the controller. 

The assignment has an inexplicable error we can not figure out, so it will not run. 
We get an error at localhost:8080

This made it hard to develop the front-end as wanted.
